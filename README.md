Steps involved in the Project:

Data Cleaning:
Removing unwanted columns.
Exploring & comparing length of messages.
Performing undersampling on dataset.
Text preparation:
Tokenization of Messages.
One hot implementation on tokenized message(corpus)
Perform word embedding
Data preparation/Data Splitting:
Split the data into training+validation(85%) & testing(15%) data.
Further split the training+validation data into training(85%) and validation(15%) data.
Model Building:
Build a model using logistic regression
Fit and Validate model on training and validation model
Model Evaluation:
gave an accuracy score of 98.47 %
